The database schema is ready. Build the backend project API routes only.

## Routes

Create REST endpoints for:
- `GET /api/projects`, list current user's project
- `POST /api/projects`, create project
- `PATCH /api/projects/[projectId]`, rename project
- `DELETE /api/projects/[projectId]`, delete project

## Rules

Use the authenticated Clerk user ID as `ownerId`.

When creating: 
- default missing project name to `Untitle Project`
- use the schema's existing ID strategy, do not add sequntial IDs

Security:
- unauthenticated request return `401`
- only the project owner can rename or delete
- non-owner mutations retuen `403`

Keep this backend-only. Do not wire the UI yet.


## Check When Done
- routes exist for list/create/rename/delete
- owner check are enfored for rename/delete
- `401` and `403` responses are handled correctly
- `npm run build` passes
